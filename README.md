# ü§ñ AI Resume Screener & Candidate Ranker

This is an intelligent HR Assistant web application designed to streamline the initial screening process for recruiters. The tool leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze, score, and rank multiple resumes against a given job description, helping to quickly identify the most qualified candidates.

The application is built entirely in Python, using Streamlit for the user interface and Scikit-learn for the core NLP analysis.

## üöÄ How to Run Locally

Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your own machine.

### 1. Prerequisites
-   [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
-   [Python 3.8+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

### 2. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd <repository-folder-name>
```

### 3. Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)
```bash
# For Windows
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate

# For macOS/Linux
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 4. Install Dependencies
Install all the required packages from the `requirements.txt` file.
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 5. Download NLTK Data
The NLTK library requires specific datasets for text processing. Run a Python interpreter and enter the following:
```python
import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('stopwords')
```

### 6. Run the Streamlit App
Launch the application using the following command:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
Your browser should automatically open with the application running!

## üí° Future Enhancements

-   **Semantic Search:** Upgrade from keyword matching to a model that understands the meaning behind words (e.g., using sentence transformers).
-   **Skill/Entity Extraction:** Automatically extract and list all identified skills, years of experience, and educational qualifications from each resume.
-   **Database Integration:** Add a database (like SQLite or Firestore) to save job descriptions and past analysis results.
